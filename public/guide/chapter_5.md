## Readme.md
Readme is the first that your colleagues read when they arrived. Readme is a part of the technical documentation; thus, it can be aimed at tech guys and provide them with all necessary tech metadata about the project to help them read the code and use the project.


Strictly use this template <https://hackmd.io/6VtoMvHuT8aHfa0KLtX_6g> to fill it properly.


## Summary
It's critical to have easy-to-understand but complete technical documentation to reduce redundant and incorrect code or it's usage. Treat those who come after you with respect.

Congratulation!
